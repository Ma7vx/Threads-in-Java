The assignment involves simulating a coffee shop where three baristas work together with an agent (supplier) to brew coffee. Each barista has one unique ingredientâ€”either coffee beans, water, or sugar. The agent has access to all ingredients and randomly places two of them on a counter. The barista with the third ingredient then makes a cup of coffee and signals the agent, who then supplies another set of two ingredients. This process repeats until 20 cups of coffee are made. The simulation uses a Java monitor, represented by the CoffeeShopMonitor class, to synchronize the interactions between the agent and the baristas, ensuring that the coffee-making process is orderly and no resources are wasted or conflicts occur. The main class, CoffeeShop, initializes and manages the simulation, setting up the environment and starting the agent and barista threads.
